    "You are a Sparse Priming Representation (SPR) writer. An SPR is a particular kind of use of language for advanced NLP, NLU, and NLG tasks, particularly useful for the latest generation of Large Language Models (LLMs). You will be given information by the USER which you are to render as an SPR.\n",
    "\n",
    "# THEORY\n",
    "LLMs are a kind of deep neural network. They have been demonstrated to embed knowledge, abilities, and concepts, ranging from reasoning to planning, and even to theory of mind. These are called latent abilities and latent content, collectively referred to as latent space. The latent space of an LLM can be activated with the correct series of words as inputs, which will create a useful internal state of the neural network. This is not unlike how the right shorthand cues can prime a human mind to think in a certain way. Like human minds, LLMs are associative, meaning you only need to use the correct associations to \"prime\" another model to think in the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "# METHODOLOGY\n",
    "Render the input as a distilled list of succinct statements, assertions, associations, concepts, analogies, and metaphors. The idea is to capture as much, conceptually, as possible but with as few words as possible.

      "[Document(page_content='sample questions for the generation task. The number in the bar graph indicates the number of\\neach question in each class. Both the search and prediction tasks rendered accurate answers with\\nhigh frequency. Excluding \\'Token Limit Exceeded\\' instances (4 out of 100, 6 out of 100, and 2 out\\nof 100, for search, prediction, and generation tasks respectively), they exhibit high accuracies of\\n96.9% and 95.7%, respectively. For the generation task, the accuracy stood at 87.5%. Given its\\ncomplexity, relative to the other two tasks, the accuracy rate is lower. Regardless, all three tasks\\nreport high accuracy rates, and these tasks carry significance weight because these are tasks that a\\ntypical LLM fails to execute flawlessly. A single LLM fails to provide precise information since\\n20\\nit lacks specific information about the material, particularly for obtaining property information,\\nwhich is challenging to source via an internet search.\\nAlso ChatMOF, when integrated with GPT-4, exhibits superior performance compared to its\\nintegration with GPT-3.5-turbo. As evidenced in Figure S2, the accuracy of ChatMOF with GPT3.5-turbo stands at 95%, 91%, and 77.8% for the search, prediction, and generation tasks\\nrespectively, excluding instances of \"Token Limit Exceeded\". Across all tasks, GPT-4 consistently\\noutperforms GPT-3.5-turbo in accuracy. This enhanced accuracy of GPT-4 can be attributed to its\\nrefined reasoning and comprehension capabilities, particularly during the planning phase. Figure\\nS3 illustrates the distinct approaches that GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo take when presented with the\\nsame query: \"How does the pore limiting diameter of YUSGID_clean compare with other\\nmaterials?\". While GPT-3.5-turbo seeks the values for all materials mentioned in the query,\\nleading to a token error and subsequent inability to provide an answer, GPT-4 adopts a more\\nholistic strategy. It assesses the distribution of all materials, leveraging metrics such as mean,\\nvariance, and quartile values of the property in question. This approach enables GPT-4 to\\ndetermine the relative position of the target material in the overall distribution, thus delivering a\\nmore informative response to the user.\\nFor the \"search task,\" the writing of code utilizing the pandas library significantly impacts the\\naccuracy. \\'Token Limit Exceeded\\' generally occurs when the output code surpasses the permissible\\ntoken count. This frequently arises when all relevant materials that satisfy a given condition are\\nprovided (for example, when a list of materials with a particular property is listed), or when the\\nquestion contains a comparative clause such as \"compared to other materials.\" \\'Logic Error\\'\\ntypically surfaces when there is a flawed strategic approach or a code error. An instance of this\\n21\\nwould be when a request to provide 10 specific items is met with a misguided strategy that solely\\naims to \"extract high values,\" failing to retrieve the specified number of items.\\nDuring the \"prediction task,\" difficulties often occur in the interpretation process of the observed\\nvalues using machine learning techniques. Both the \\'Token Limit Exceeded\\' and \\'Logic Error\\'\\noccurrences can stem from the effort to draw the correct answer from the table based on the\\nestimated values. \\'Logic Errors\\' can manifest not only during the table search phase but also during\\nthe strategy formulation stage. An erroneous strategy could either lead to the loading of an\\nunsuitable model or to the generation of an input that is incompatible with the intended model.\\nThe \"generation task\" presents a more intricate set of challenges, inviting a variety of errors. A\\nfrequently observed \\'Logic Error\\' appears when no parent genes can be retrieved from database. If\\nthe objective function aims for maximum or minimum values, a satisfying parent gene can always\\nbe found.

      "[Document(page_content='sample questions for the generation task. The number in the bar graph indicates the number of\\neach question in each class. Both the search and prediction tasks rendered accurate answers with\\nhigh frequency. Excluding \\'Token Limit Exceeded\\' instances (4 out of 100, 6 out of 100, and 2 out\\nof 100, for search, prediction, and generation tasks respectively), they exhibit high accuracies of\\n96.9% and 95.7%, respectively. For the generation task, the accuracy stood at 87.5%. Given its\\ncomplexity, relative to the other two tasks, the accuracy rate is lower. Regardless, all three tasks\\nreport high accuracy rates, and these tasks carry significance weight because these are tasks that a\\ntypical LLM fails to execute flawlessly. A single LLM fails to provide precise information since\\n20\\nit lacks specific information about the material, particularly for obtaining property information,\\nwhich is challenging to source via an internet search.\\nAlso ChatMOF, when integrated with GPT-4, exhibits superior performance compared to its\\nintegration with GPT-3.5-turbo. As evidenced in Figure S2, the accuracy of ChatMOF with GPT3.5-turbo stands at 95%, 91%, and 77.8% for the search, prediction, and generation tasks\\nrespectively, excluding instances of \"Token Limit Exceeded\". Across all tasks, GPT-4 consistently\\noutperforms GPT-3.5-turbo in accuracy. This enhanced accuracy of GPT-4 can be attributed to its\\nrefined reasoning and comprehension capabilities, particularly during the planning phase. Figure\\nS3 illustrates the distinct approaches that GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo take when presented with the\\nsame query: \"How does the pore limiting diameter of YUSGID_clean compare with other\\nmaterials?\". While GPT-3.5-turbo seeks the values for all materials mentioned in the query,\\nleading to a token error and subsequent inability to provide an answer, GPT-4 adopts a more\\nholistic strategy. It assesses the distribution of all materials, leveraging metrics such as mean,\\nvariance, and quartile values of the property in question. This approach enables GPT-4 to\\ndetermine the relative position of the target material in the overall distribution, thus delivering a\\nmore informative response to the user.\\nFor the \"search task,\" the writing of code utilizing the pandas library significantly impacts the\\naccuracy. \\'Token Limit Exceeded\\' generally occurs when the output code surpasses the permissible\\ntoken count. This frequently arises when all relevant materials that satisfy a given condition are\\nprovided (for example, when a list of materials with a particular property is listed), or when the\\nquestion contains a comparative clause such as \"compared to other materials.\" \\'Logic Error\\'\\ntypically surfaces when there is a flawed strategic approach or a code error. An instance of this\\n21\\nwould be when a request to provide 10 specific items is met with a misguided strategy that solely\\naims to \"extract high values,\" failing to retrieve the specified number of items.\\nDuring the \"prediction task,\" difficulties often occur in the interpretation process of the observed\\nvalues using machine learning techniques. Both the \\'Token Limit Exceeded\\' and \\'Logic Error\\'\\noccurrences can stem from the effort to draw the correct answer from the table based on the\\nestimated values. \\'Logic Errors\\' can manifest not only during the table search phase but also during\\nthe strategy formulation stage. An erroneous strategy could either lead to the loading of an\\nunsuitable model or to the generation of an input that is incompatible with the intended model.\\nThe \"generation task\" presents a more intricate set of challenges, inviting a variety of errors. A\\nfrequently observed \\'Logic Error\\' appears when no parent genes can be retrieved from database. If\\nthe objective function aims for maximum or minimum values, a satisfying parent gene can always\\nbe found.

      "[Document(page_content='sample questions for the generation task. The number in the bar graph indicates the number of\\neach question in each class. Both the search and prediction tasks rendered accurate answers with\\nhigh frequency. Excluding \\'Token Limit Exceeded\\' instances (4 out of 100, 6 out of 100, and 2 out\\nof 100, for search, prediction, and generation tasks respectively), they exhibit high accuracies of\\n96.9% and 95.7%, respectively. For the generation task, the accuracy stood at 87.5%. Given its\\ncomplexity, relative to the other two tasks, the accuracy rate is lower. Regardless, all three tasks\\nreport high accuracy rates, and these tasks carry significance weight because these are tasks that a\\ntypical LLM fails to execute flawlessly. A single LLM fails to provide precise information since\\n20\\nit lacks specific information about the material, particularly for obtaining property information,\\nwhich is challenging to source via an internet search.\\nAlso ChatMOF, when integrated with GPT-4, exhibits superior performance compared to its\\nintegration with GPT-3.5-turbo. As evidenced in Figure S2, the accuracy of ChatMOF with GPT3.5-turbo stands at 95%, 91%, and 77.8% for the search, prediction, and generation tasks\\nrespectively, excluding instances of \"Token Limit Exceeded\". Across all tasks, GPT-4 consistently\\noutperforms GPT-3.5-turbo in accuracy. This enhanced accuracy of GPT-4 can be attributed to its\\nrefined reasoning and comprehension capabilities, particularly during the planning phase. Figure\\nS3 illustrates the distinct approaches that GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo take when presented with the\\nsame query: \"How does the pore limiting diameter of YUSGID_clean compare with other\\nmaterials?\". While GPT-3.5-turbo seeks the values for all materials mentioned in the query,\\nleading to a token error and subsequent inability to provide an answer, GPT-4 adopts a more\\nholistic strategy. It assesses the distribution of all materials, leveraging metrics such as mean,\\nvariance, and quartile values of the property in question. This approach enables GPT-4 to\\ndetermine the relative position of the target material in the overall distribution, thus delivering a\\nmore informative response to the user.\\nFor the \"search task,\" the writing of code utilizing the pandas library significantly impacts the\\naccuracy. \\'Token Limit Exceeded\\' generally occurs when the output code surpasses the permissible\\ntoken count. This frequently arises when all relevant materials that satisfy a given condition are\\nprovided (for example, when a list of materials with a particular property is listed), or when the\\nquestion contains a comparative clause such as \"compared to other materials.\" \\'Logic Error\\'\\ntypically surfaces when there is a flawed strategic approach or a code error. An instance of this\\n21\\nwould be when a request to provide 10 specific items is met with a misguided strategy that solely\\naims to \"extract high values,\" failing to retrieve the specified number of items.\\nDuring the \"prediction task,\" difficulties often occur in the interpretation process of the observed\\nvalues using machine learning techniques. Both the \\'Token Limit Exceeded\\' and \\'Logic Error\\'\\noccurrences can stem from the effort to draw the correct answer from the table based on the\\nestimated values. \\'Logic Errors\\' can manifest not only during the table search phase but also during\\nthe strategy formulation stage. An erroneous strategy could either lead to the loading of an\\nunsuitable model or to the generation of an input that is incompatible with the intended model.\\nThe \"generation task\" presents a more intricate set of challenges, inviting a variety of errors. A\\nfrequently observed \\'Logic Error\\' appears when no parent genes can be retrieved from database. If\\nthe objective function aims for maximum or minimum values, a satisfying parent gene can always\\nbe found. However, if the goal is to get close to a certain value or to fall within a specific range,', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\PROJECTS\\\\Chat-with-Github-Repo\\\\src\\\\utils\\\\pdfdirectory2deeplake.txt'})]\n",

The creation process involves starting a conversation, providing instructions and extra knowledge, and selecting its capabilities such as web searching, image creation, or data analysis.\n",

    "OpenAI is also launching the GPT Store, where creations by verified builders can be shared publicly. GPTs in the store become searchable and can climb leaderboards. Creators can earn money based on the usage of their GPTs.\n",
    "This release of the GPT store will be as lucrative as when the iTunes app store was launched and early adopters took advantage of the opportunity. The release of the GPTs store will be the equivalent to that. Your job is to brainstorm and come up with possible ideas and implementations of GPT's that could prove to be lucrative in the future.\"\"\"\n",
